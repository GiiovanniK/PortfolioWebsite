                    <p class="projectAbout">The concept of behavioural design focuses on changing the behavior of a
                        specific target
                        group through design. Our project aimed to raise awareness about online sexual violence among
                        high school
                        students. This project was a collaboration with the University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam,
                        Victim Support Netherlands and Q42.

                <p class="projectAbout w-75">Through extensive research, we concluded that, as designers, we cannot
                    eliminate the problem of online sexual violence but can effectively raise awareness about it and try
                    to prevent it from happening. One
                    challenge we identified was that high school students tend to ignore posters and other informational
                    materials provided by the school. To address this, we decided to display the information in school
                    toilets, a place where students naturally spend time and feel exposed, making them more likely to
                    notice and engage with the content.</p>

                <p class="projectAbout w-75">Today, many social movements effectively raise awareness, so we decided to
                    try and start a movement ourselves. In behavioural design, this principle is known as social proof,
                    which refers to the influence that the actions and attitudes of others have on our own behavior. We
                    needed to consider which social media platforms high school students use most frequently and
                    identified Snapchat and Instagram as the primary ones. These apps are also commonly used in cases of
                    online sexual assault. Therefore, we created a camera filter for these apps, allowing students to
                    send pictures with these filters to each other, thereby spreading awareness.
